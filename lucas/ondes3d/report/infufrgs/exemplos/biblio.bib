abstract = {The large processing requirements of seismic wave propagation simulations make High Performance Computing (HPC) architectures a natural choice for their execution. However, to keep both the current pace of performance improvements and the power consumption under a strict power budget, HPC systems must be more energy efficient than ever. As a response to this need, energy-efficient and low-power processors began to make their way into the market. In this paper we employ a novel low-power processor, the MPPA-256 manycore, to perform seismic wave propagation simulations. It has 256 cores connected by a NoC, no cache-coherence and only a limited amount of on-chip memory. We describe how its particular architectural characteristics influenced our solution for an energy-efficient implementation. As a counterpoint to the low-power MPPA-256 architecture, we employ Xeon Phi, a performance-centric manycore. Although both processors share some architectural similarities, the challenges to implement an efficient seismic wave propagation kernel on these platforms are very different. In this work we compare the performance and energy efficiency of our implementations for these processors to proven and optimized solutions for other hardware platforms such as general-purpose processors and a GPU. Our experimental results show that MPPA-256 has the best energy efficiency, consuming at least 77% less energy than the other evaluated platforms, whereas the performance of our solution for the Xeon Phi is on par with a state-of-the-art solution for GPUs.}

abstract = {Summary Parallel applications executing in contemporary heterogeneous clusters are complex to code and optimize. The task-based programming model is an alternative to handle the coding complexity. This model consists of splitting the problem domain into tasks with dependencies through a directed acyclic graph, and submit the set of tasks to a runtime scheduler that maps each task dynamically to resources. We consider that computational fluid dynamics applications are typical in scientific computing but not enough exploited by designs that employ the task-based programming model. This article presents task-based parallel strategies for a simple CFD application that targets heterogeneous multi-CPU/multi-GPU computing resources. We design, develop, evaluate, and compare the performance of three parallel strategies (naive, ghost-cells, and arrow) of a task-based heterogeneous (CPU and GPU) application that simulates the flow of an incompressible Newtonian fluid with constant viscosity. All implementations rely on the StarPU runtime, and we use the StarVZ toolkit to conduct comprehensive performance analysis. Results indicate that the ghost cell strategy provides the best speedup (77×) considering the simulation time when the GPU resources still have available memory. However, the arrow strategy achieves better results when the simulation data increases.},

abstract = {A new technique of free-space simulation has been developed for solving unbounded electromagnetic problems with the finite-difference time-domain method. Referred to as PML, the new technique is based on the use of an absorbing layer especially designed to absorb without reflection the electromagnetic waves. The first part of the paper presents the theory of the PML technique. The second part is devoted to numerical experiments and to numerical comparisons with the previously used techniques of free-space simulation. These comparisons show that the PML technique works better than the others in all cases; using it allows us to obtain a higher accuracy in some problems and a release of computational requirements in some others.}

abstract = {Abstract A novel implementation of perfectly matched layer (PML) media is presented for the termination of FDTD lattices. The implementation is based on the stretched coordinate form of the PML, a recursive convolution, and the use of complex frequency, shifted (CFS) PML parameters. The method, referred to here as the convolutional PML (CPML), offers a number of advantages over the traditional implementations of the PML. Specifically, the application of the CPML is completely independent of the host medium. Thus, no modifications are necessary when applying it to inhomogeneous, lossy, anisotropic, dispersive, or nonlinear media. Secondly, it is shown that the CFS–PML is highly absorptive of evanescent modes and can provide significant memory savings when computing the wave interaction of elongated structures, sharp corners, or low-frequency excitations. © 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.
